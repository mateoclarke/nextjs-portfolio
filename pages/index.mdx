# Mateo Salinas Clarke

Hello, I'm a Civic Technologist & Software Engineering Lead at Colorado Digital Service.

I am passionate about public service and participation in the civic space to create resilient and enriching communities. I'm also a big fan of open data, open-source software, soccer, playing music, riding bikes, and eating tacos.
