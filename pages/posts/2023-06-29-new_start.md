When I first started in software development, I kept detailed notes on everything I was learning. I posted occasional blog articles to document how I overcame a challenge and I'd often need to revisit the wisdom of my past self when I got myself stuck back in the same rut.

But as I started to have more responsibility for managing people and projects, the time to reflect on my own growth through the discipline of drafting my thoughts took the backseat to other priorities. But if you didn't document it, did it really even happen?

Here's to a new start.
