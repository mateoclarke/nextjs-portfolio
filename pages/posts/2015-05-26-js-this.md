# In Javascript, `this` is confusing

`this` is a special variable in Javascript because its available everywhere.

It can be used in:

- functions
- outside functions (in the top-level scope)
- in a string passed to `eval()`

## What I learned

One of the benefits to using **strict mode** in javascript is that if you make a mistake using `this`, strict mode assigns `this` to `undefined` instead of the global object (`window` in the browser).

### Example pitfall

- If you forget the keyword `new` when invoking a constructor function, `this` could be assigned to the global object if you were in "sloppy mode".
