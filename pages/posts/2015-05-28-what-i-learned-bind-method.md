title: What I Learned Yesterday - _.bind method
---

_Every day at AcademicWorks, the Engineering Team has a Dev Sync where we share something we learned from the day before. Often times we'll hear about some new movie, a cool Kickstarter project, or an interesting ruby gem. Our VP of Engineering has issued a challenge to our team. Whoever can teach something they learned from the day before that is technical in nature and directly related to our work for 20 consecutive days will win a prize. Here is what I learned yesterday..._

## What I learned

As I mentioned earlier [this week](insert_link), the keyword `this` in Javascript is confusing.

If we aren't careful, the context for any function we run can be different from what we expect. The keyword `this` can refer to the object that is calling the function. But sometimes we want `this` to be explicitly bound or set always to same object.

Here at AW, we use [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/#bind)'s `_.bind` method. One specific example is how we use bind within a jQuery event listener to explicitly bind our function to the instance of a module that was instantiated with a constructor function.

```javascript
this.$el.on(
  'click',
  '.js-target-container',
  _.bind(this.toggleActionButton, this)
)
```
